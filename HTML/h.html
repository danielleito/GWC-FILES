<p align="center">Recent technologies are used by professionals to  manipulate and alter pictures. In media, these photos are specifically manipulated to be biased towards skinnier models and better than average girls. Modeling agencies and companies edit images to get a certain look across depending on the situation. Usually, models in high end fashion, such as Gucci, or not exclusively high end fashion, such as Victoria's Secret, digitally edit their models to get a certain look. This look is very skinny yet somewhat curvy. Overall, photo editing tools in general influence the general public's views on body image for primarily females.

<p align="left">Modeling before photoshop was very genuine. Because the cameras weren't too good back then, there was not much the photographers could do to manipulate images and deceive the eye. In the early 1900s, women's fashion was long dresses with ridiculous hats. The key to a good body was thin stomach and thick waist. In order to achieve this look they wore corsets and, occasionally, even wore an underwire butt shape to make their butt look larger. Photos of these ladies were usually taken from the side to show off this curvaceous figure. In the 1920s, women began to wear looser clothing or more gender neutral clothing. These women who didn't have to be all curves. This remained a continuous trend, but as time progressed and fashion companies changed what was in season, a drastic change occurred in the 1950's. The fashion was small waists and large hips was still in so once again all of the models hips were at least seven inches wider. Dresses became shorter and it became more suitable for woman to work and dress in women’s suits.</p>

<h3><a name="GUCCI">Modeling For High End Companies (alt-2)</a></h3>

<p align="left">In order to be a model today, it certainly depends on the company. High end companies such as Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Ferragamo are known for their abnormally thin models. The requirements for females to model for such companies are to be 5 feet 10 inches and generally under 135 pounds. 135 for being 5 feet 10 inches is the minimum to be a healthy weight for that specified height according to the Gucci model recruiting website. But, according to other sources the average model is 5 foot 11 inches and weighs 117 pounds. Judging from pictures of high end fashion models that seems about correct, this means that models are grotesquely unhealthy.   This past April,, an ad for Gucci was produced and aired but had to be taken down due to their models appearing "unhealthily thin". These models are examples in society for what girls should look like. Young girls look up to these models and aspire to be like them. Knowing this, the American Standards Authority took this down therefore; these models are unhealthy and should not be displayed due to their health. The requirements for modeling set by the big industries are so particular that females are often discouraged to even try to model. Or when they do, they find themselves in unhealthy situations both mentally and physically. Meaning, these women and girls starve themselves or develop eating disorders in order to reach the perfect weight and look to match the company. In fact, up to 40% of women models have eating disorders. If the professionals have trouble maintaining their weight, how can mundane people be expected to?

<h3><a name="REVENGE">Striking Back (alt-3)</a></h3>

<p align="left">These models ads are what are put out there to be a representation of the culture and fashion in an era. But, some people believe that it is not an accurate representation of what society should look like. Outraged people in France led to the banning of ultra thin models in late December, 2015. The fashion industry is very angry with this response but also whilst banning ultra-skinny models, the French law states that if and when photos are photoshopped and edited, they have to specifically say, "retouched photograph" or else they can pay a heavy fine. In addition to modeling, these professionals must show proof of a current healthy BMI from the doctors. All of these actions were due to the government being forced to step in and take action. Even with these laws and regulations, nobody is directly taking responsibility. Companies who are the one's instilling the requirements and make the ultimate decisions for the people being hired are the one's who aren't taking responsibility. They are trying to blame the atmosphere and the pressure the models immerse themselves into when in reality it all came from the companies to begin with. These women are just doing what they believe is right to keep a job and be showcased. </p>

<h3><a name="FIX">Fixes (alt-4)</a></h3>

<p align="left">As a fix for this upcoming problem of women models and their ultra-thinness, is to get rid of the pressure to be thin. Women today are surrounded by images of people who are perfect in the media's sense, they are surrounded by supermodels who look happy and look like they are living the best life when in reality they are as sad as the rest of the public. To fix this problem, companies can advertise the average woman wearing their products. Also, more ads all around about loving your body and to be positive with who people are. Women should feel comfortable in their bodies and not have to think about it every fifteen minutes. Too often than not, women compare themselves to people they are nothing like and judge others. There is peer pressure that may not be intentional but leave a big impression. Only two percent of women are actually happy with their bodies. In the UK the average size is a 14 yet a large majority of women believe that a size 12 is fat. This is due to the women in the media being displayed are usually around a size 8. Also, even while being a size 8 these models are still digitally edited to make them appear smaller.

<h3><a name="FEELINGS">How Females Feel (alt-5)</a></h3>

<p align="left">Some females see these advertisements and these models who are photoshopped and feel very upset at how it makes them feel. In November of 2014 there was a Calvin Klein ad for "plus-sized models". She was a size 8 edited to be a size 10. Many women were outraged because the average size for a woman in the United States is a 12 yet this plus sized model doesn't even meet the requirement to be considered average. The model does not consider herself plus-sized either, she believes that she was only considered that position to Calvin due to the comparison of the rest of their models. After the outbreak or rage from the Calvin Klein viewers, they changed her campaign for the "perfectly fit line". Around this time in November as well, Victoria’s Secrets campaign showcased multiple women standing side by side in lingerie with the stamp on the top saying 'The Perfect "Body"'. This implies that the perfect body are the Victoria’s Secret models who have a thin bodies with nice boobs, some curves, and a nice jawline and cheekbones. They all have the same body type and are being advertised as the "perfect body". Women across the nation were enraged and made a petition that 26,000 people signed to make Victoria’s Secret apologize and terminate the campaign. In the end, the company never apologized and only changed the slogan to "A Body for Every Body" with the same image of the photoshopped, same photo.

<h3 align="center">My Thoughts</h3>
<p align="center">As an impressionable teenager, seeing these models and their perfect bodies makes me want to hate my body and I think that it needs to stop. There was a time where I put myself in the situation where I thought I needed to be skinnier and I would always look at my body with great disdain. Looking back, I realize it was dumb of me to think that and to try to go to extreme measures but there are girls all over the world who will not realize this until it is too late. As a whole, there needs to be a stoppage of digital editing to make models look unhealthy and way better than average. There needs to be ads for body love and an accurate representation of all body types in media. </p>
