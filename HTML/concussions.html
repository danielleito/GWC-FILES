<br><br><p align="left">The brain is made of soft tissue. It's cushioned by spinal fluid and encased in the protective shell of the skull. When you sustain a concussion, the impact can jolt your brain. Sometimes, it literally causes it to move around in your head. Traumatic brain injuries can cause bruising, damage to the blood vessels, and injury to the nerves. A concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury that is caused by a blow to the head or body, a fall, or another injury that jars or shakes the brain inside the skull. Although there may be cuts or bruises on the head or face, there may be no other visible signs of a brain injury.</p>

<p align="left">Seek medical attention. A health care professional can decide how serious the concussion is and whether you require treatment. If you have suffered a grade 1 or grade 2 concussion, wait until symptoms are gone before returning to normal activities. That could take several minutes, hours, days, or even a weeks. Depends on how many concussions one has sustained prior to the incident and how hard one was hit. For some, it may be their fifth concussion and they might feel the symptons for the next two to three years. If it is one of your first concussions, should only take weeks to recover.</p>

<p align="center">I have a concussion and it sucks, do not poke the bear and continue playing through it. Take time off if you really need to, your head is not something to mess around with. You need your brain to be healthy and fine for the rest of your life, no one game is more important than your health. Be smart about it and see a doctor if needed. </p>
